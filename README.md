# Linux Networks Red Teaming Lab

This is a lab to learn about various network services, how to enumerate them, and how to pivot through machines as you compromise them.


## Getting Started

To launch the lab, you'll need Virtualbox and Vagrant:

1. Clone this repository
2. `cd` into the repository
3. run `vagrant up`

This will open a Kali VM with the lab, but it will take a good 15-20 minutes (maybe more depending on your internet) for all the services to start.

## Lab Walkthrough
For a walkthrough of the lab, see the [walkthrough](docs/walkthrough.md) document.
